# Fake_News_Classification_Project
In today's digital age, the rapid spread of misinformation poses a significant threat to public discourse and informed decision-making. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying news articles as either "real" or "fake." 
Problem Statement:The challenge of distinguishing between legitimate and fabricated news articles is complex, as fake news is often crafted to mimic the style and tone of authentic journalism. Manual fact-checking is slow and inefficient, making it difficult to keep pace with the sheer volume of online content. This project tackles this problem by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the textual content of articles and build a predictive model.
Methodology:
Data Source
Data Preprocessing
Feature Extraction
Model Selection and Training
Model Evaluation

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, NLTK

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
